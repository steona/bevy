Flex Based Portlet - Rich Internet Application


# Details #

Sometime ago I had posted an entry on my blog at blog.sun.com [my official blog :-)](http://blogs.sun.com/insidemyhead/entry/flex_up_your_portlets) about how to leverage a rich client application development environment like Flex to build a rich user interface in a portlet. There is a screencast on that blog entry that shows the portlet in action. The screencast shows a portlet I had developed that will present a user with some kind of a legel document (NDA, EULA) etc. and present the user with a canvas area which the user can use to E-Sign it using his mouse.

I recently posted the portlet and its associated Web Service on Project Bevy

Feel free to download the archive from the [Bevy Download Page](http://code.google.com/p/bevy/downloads/list). The download consists of a Zip file which contains a readme.html file. Please go through the README and follow instructions to deploy and use it on your portlet container.
